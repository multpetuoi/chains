In this article, we will show you how to use DreamScape V.2.5 to create a simple landscape scene in 3ds Max. We will cover the basic steps of creating a terrain, a sky and a water surface, and rendering the final image.
 
## Step 1: Creating a Terrain
 
To create a terrain with DreamScape V.2.5, you need to use the DreamScape Terra object. This is a special object that allows you to generate and edit terrains using various parameters and modifiers.
 
To create a DreamScape Terra object, go to Create > Geometry > DreamScape and click on the Terra button. Then click and drag in the viewport to create a plane. You can adjust the size and segments of the plane as needed.
 
Once you have created the plane, you can use the Modify panel to access the DreamScape Terra parameters. Here you can change the height map, the erosion effects, the textures and the vegetation of the terrain. You can also add modifiers such as noise, smooth, displace and more to further customize the terrain.
 
For this example, we will use the following settings:

- Height Map: Fractal Noise
- Erosion: Thermal
- Texture: Auto
- Vegetation: None

You can experiment with different settings to create different types of terrains. You can also use the interactive viewport preview to see how your terrain looks in real time.
 
## Step 2: Creating a Sky
 
To create a sky with DreamScape V.2.5, you need to use the DreamScape Sky object. This is a special object that allows you to create realistic skies with volumetric clouds, sun, moon and stars.
 
To create a DreamScape Sky object, go to Create > Geometry > DreamScape and click on the Sky button. Then click anywhere in the viewport to create a sky dome. You can adjust the radius and segments of the dome as needed.
 
Once you have created the dome, you can use the Modify panel to access the DreamScape Sky parameters. Here you can change the time of day, the location, the weather, the cloud types and density, and more.
 
For this example, we will use the following settings:

- Time: 12:00 PM
- Location: Kansas City
- Weather: Clear
- Clouds: Cumulus
- Density: 0.3

You can experiment with different settings to create different types of skies. You can also use the interactive viewport preview to see how your sky looks in real time.
 
## Step 3: Creating a Water Surface
 
To create a water surface with DreamScape V.2.5, you need to use the DreamScape SeaSurface object. This is a special object that allows you to simulate realistic water surfaces with waves, foam, reflections and refractions.
 
To create a DreamScape SeaSurface object, go to Create > Geometry > DreamScape and click on the SeaSurface button. Then click and drag in the viewport to create a plane. You can adjust the size and segments of the plane as needed.
 
Once you have created the plane, you can use the Modify panel to access the DreamScape SeaSurface parameters. Here you can change the wave height and speed, the foam amount and color, the reflection and refraction options, and more.
 
For this example, we will use the following settings:

- Wave Height: 0.5 m
- Wave Speed: 1 m/s
- Foam Amount: 0.1
- Foam Color: White
- Reflection: On
- Refraction: On

You can experiment with different settings to create different types of water surfaces. You can also use the interactive viewport preview to see how your water surface looks in real time.
